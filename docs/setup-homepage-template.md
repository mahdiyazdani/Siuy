# Create and setup a homepage template

By default after fresh installation of [Siuy](https://wordpress.org/themes/siuy/) theme, the homepage will look like a **blog**, and this is how WordPress is intended to work. This is the same page template used on the [Siuy Demo](https://demo.mypreview.one/siuy/).

?> Siuy theme comes with a unique **Homepage template** which is perfect for mobile application showcase websites, as it displays a lot of block-level contents and variety of UI components to visitors as soon as they land on your website.

* Create a new page, by visiting **Pages** » **Add New**.
* Set the **page title** and then from the Template drop-down in the **Page Attributes** meta box select **Homepage template**.
* **Publish** the page.
* Navigate to **Settings** » **Reading** and set the newly created page as a **front page**.

The page that you created and added the homepage page template to will now be displayed when anyone visits your site's homepage.

?> If you’d like to reorder the components on the homepage, purchase a copy of [Siuy Plus](https://www.mypreview.one) plugin and use **homepage control section** to customize the homepage template layout, add new components, rearrange or hide sections, toggle components and much more.

!> Remember, if you want to have a page to **display your blog posts** too, you will have to create another page (you can leave the content blank) and set that as the Posts Page in the same settings section like above where we created a blank page titled **Blog** on our site and set that as the **posts page**.
